                    <h2>Dogs!</h2>
                    <p>
                        The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse variety of choices as
                        there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization. Adopting a
                        dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of
                        having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog.
                        Studies even show medical indicators such as <a
                            href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554">reduced blood
                            pressure and improved lipid profiles</a>. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure
                        that you care for your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough
                        opportunities for exercise. In this
                        page, you will find more information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
                        stages of their lives.

                    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Diet & Exercise</h2>
                    Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as they mature.
                    Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then introduced to three meals per day
                    when they are about three to six months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to
                    two meals per day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to one
                    meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass is composed of
                    somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The <a
                        href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a> says just a 10
                    percent decrease in body water can cause illness,
                    and a 15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you
                    keep your pooch hydrated!

                <div class="dom-content-container">
                    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Grooming & Handling</h2>
                    Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So be sure to brush
                    frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and prevent matted and tangled fur that can
                    prove to be extremely difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
                    especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only important to your dog’s
                    health but can be an exercise depending on how strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the
                    soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your
                    puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how
                    you handle your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be cautious as you
                    carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the
                    chest and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the belly
                    with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and
                    rear as you lift.

                    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Vaccinations & Medications</h2>
                    You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that
                    are typically recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as
                    hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your vet depending on the
                    environment in which the dog resides. Some of these include <a
